Had I only and endless supply of time..

## Thoughts
This was a fun assignment, bringing me back to when we created fullstack applications in school.
But with all of the knowledge I have now. And React being the only framework in common.

I've only ever worked with PostgreSQL using Django's ORM in Python, and thought it would be a fun challenge to set it up for a GO application, and I've learned a lot.

------

And usually I wouldn't push everything straight to Main, but..
Since this is only an assignment,
and it was a sprint to the finish line..

I'm usually better, swearsies.
