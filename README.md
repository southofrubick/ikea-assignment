## Thoughts
This was a fun assignment, bringing me back to when we created fullstack applications in school.
But with all of the knowledge I have now. And React being the only framework in common.

I've only ever worked with PostgreSQL using Django's ORM in Python, and thought it would be a fun challenge to set it up for a GO application, and I've learned a lot.
